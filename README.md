# ArrayUtility
 Project 4 - Solving a specific problem using nested loops, arrays, and if-else statements

The challenge in the project is developing algorithms that accomplishes basic operations over an array of integer numbers.

The three operations are:

- Find the minimum (smallest) value that appears in the array
- Find the maximum (largest) value that appears in the array
- Determine the number of unique values that appear in the array

Develop an algorithm for each of those tasks.  The algorithms should work for any size of array. If the array is empty (i.e., doesn't include any elements/values) the algorithm should output a zero. 

Keep in mind that like any computational problem there are several approaches to achieve a solution. For this programming checkpoint your will need to utilize loops and conditional statements.

Write the pseudocode or flowchart for the algorithm and store it in a file (file format can be text, pdf or doc) with the name arrayUtilSteps.
